#Fresh start

It has been a while for any public bloging for me. I belive I have tried to setup a blog for quite few times during last at least 12 years. *Well* better later than **never**. Wisdom comes with .. expirence.

Today I have set up couple of areas for this blog (voicing the ideas, create the commitment):
* Learnings / Tips on Cloud tech. Focus mainly on Microsoft Azure (Azure), Kubernetes (k8s), distributed systems
* Perspective on startup / business ecosystem of places where I am living (in this case Baltic countries)
* Share thing or two about Product Managment (bookmarking as well)
* Random ;) (well no politics)

Over last 12 years of profesional working career I have learned a thing or two. Of course there is a lot more to learn and apply! But it feels like a good spot to share these learnings.
